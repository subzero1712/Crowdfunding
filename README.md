# Crowdfunding
A decentralized crowdfunding platform built with Solidity, Web3.js, Node.js, and Ganache. It lets users create campaigns, contribute Ether via MetaMask, and ensures secure, transparent transactions. Campaigns are goal-based, with automatic refunds if targets aren't met within the deadline.
